# Projectile Motion

## Introduction

A projectile motion from the kinematics class is described as a parabola or
quadratic equation. First, we have our acceleration vector with magnitude $$g$$
where $$g$$ is gravity equals to $$9.8m/s^2$$, and pointing to the center of the
earth. That is:

$$ \vec{a} = -g \hat{j} $$

So we have that:

$$ \vec{v} = -gt \hat{j} + \vec{v_0} $$

$$ \vec{r} = -\frac{1}{2}gt^2 \hat{j} + \vec{v_0}t $$

Where $$\vec{v_0}$$ is the initial speed.

These equations model a projectile's motion at time $$t$$. If we remove the
parameter from the position vector, and remove the third component to work with
a plane, we get the following shape:

$$ x(t) = t, y(t) = -\frac{1}{2}gt^2$$

Thus, our motion equation describes a parabola or quadratic equation.
