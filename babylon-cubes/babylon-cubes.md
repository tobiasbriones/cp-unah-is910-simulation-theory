# Babylon Cubes

## Introduction

Computer simulations are an innovative technology in this era. They can help to
visualize industrial processes, real-time processes, running scientific
experiments and, many more.

Computer graphics either 2D or 3D are fundamental to computer simulations so one
can see real life looking results. This leads to the development of say, 3D
models so that they can be rendered into a virtual canvas and be interactive. In
order to achieve this result on the internet browser using web technology like
HTML and JS, a library called Babylon.js can be used.
